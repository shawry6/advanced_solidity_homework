## Week 21 Homework: Advanced Solidity

Please see `my_PupperCoinCrowdsale.sol` for the deployable file. 

The PupperCoin network will be used to track dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. We have already worked with the necessary legal bodies and obtained the green light on creating a crowdsale open to the public. However, we have enabled refunds if the crowdsale is successful and the goal is met. Our crowdsale goal is capped at 300 ether and will run for 24 weeks.
